# PHP IP Lookup
### Whats is that?
It's a simple PHP file to know your IP address. It also shows you more info, like the timezone, your Internet provider or your aprox. location using a Geolocation Plugin. The location is displayed in a OpenStreet Map, and the other info in a Html table. 

This is a very simple and fancy way to display this info. This is a example executing the script in Worpress: https://peekip.ml.

### Requirements
- PHP 7 or higher

  This script doesn't need any exernal files. It's all included in this repostory. 
  
### Usage
- ##### For Wordpress users:
  If you use Wordpress, you can use the 'XYZ PHP Code' plugin to execute this PHP script in a page using shortcodes. It's very simple to use.
- ##### For other users:
  Just put and execute the 'index.php' file in your webserver. You can clone this repostory on you computer using the command ``` git clone ```

## And that's all, have fun coding :)
