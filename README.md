# PHP IP Lookup
### Whats is that?
It's a simple PHP file to know your IP address.It also shows you more info using a Geolocation Plugin, like the timezone, your Internet provider or your aprox. location. The location is displayed in a OpenStreet Map, and the other info is displayed in a Html table. This is a very simple and fancy way to display this info. This is a example: https://peekip.ml.

### Requirements
- PHP 7 or higher

  This script doesn't need any exernal files. It's all included in the same script.

### Usage
##### For Wordpress users:
If you use Wordpress, you can use the 'XYZ PHP Code' plugin to execute this PHP script in a page using shortcodes. Its very simple to use.
##### For other users:
Just put and execute the 'index.php' file in your webserver. You can clone this repostory on you computer using the command ``` git clone ```

## And that's all, have fun coding :)
